Linus Torvalds started the Linux kernel project in 1991 while he was a student at the University of Helsinki, Finland. 
He released the first version of the Linux kernel on September 17, 1991, and it has since become the foundation for countless Linux distributions

 In 2005, Linus Torvalds created Git, a distributed version control system, in response to dissatisfaction with the version control tools available at the time, 
 particularly BitKeeper, which had previously been used for managing the Linux kernelâ€™s source code.

 Torvalds has made it clear that his views on software freedom differ from those of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 
 While Stallman emphasizes the ethical and moral aspects of software freedom, Torvalds focuses more on the technical and practical advantages of open source
