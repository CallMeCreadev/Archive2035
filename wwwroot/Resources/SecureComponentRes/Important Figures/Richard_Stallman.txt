Richard Stallman created the GNU Project in 1983, which provided the necessary tools and libraries that, 
when combined with the Linux kernel, created a fully functional operating system. 
The combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel is often referred to as GNU/Linux

Richard Stallman is also the original author of GNU Emacs, a highly extensible and customizable text editor. 
Emacs is one of the earliest and most influential pieces of software produced by the GNU Project

In 1985, Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to support the GNU Project and advocate for software freedom. 
The FSF promotes the use of free software licenses, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), which Stallman wrote to ensure that software remains free and open
