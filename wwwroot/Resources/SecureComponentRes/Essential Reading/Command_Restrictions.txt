Sysadmins are users with limited authority
We have restricted their accounts to prevent the use of most Linux commands that may interfere with our files
The following Commands are enabled to give sysadmins a ReadOnly style of permission

cd [directory] can be used to move to a specific directory or cd.. can be used to leave the current directory
ls can be used to list the contents of the directory. We have enabled the extension -a so that sysadmins can view hidden files using ls -a
cat can be used to print the content of text files to the terminal but we have restricteed file concatenation
clear is enabled so sysadmins can navigate the terminal with greater usability
