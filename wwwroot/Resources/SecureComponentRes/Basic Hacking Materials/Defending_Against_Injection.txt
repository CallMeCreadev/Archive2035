If you are defending against SQL Injection you won't need to tripple check some regular expression to try and counter every string manipulation 
someone might inject into your database.
Back in 2002 Microsoft and Oracle both implemented their own versions of SqlCommand  and OracleCommand to simplify this.
Here is an example:

string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @Username";
SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Username", userInput);

This causes the Database to identify ahead of time that the query is using placeholders.
The Database is then able to acknowledge that the value going into @Username is data and cannot be a SQL command;
This is because the execution plan has already been compiled and prepared before the userInput has been processed
