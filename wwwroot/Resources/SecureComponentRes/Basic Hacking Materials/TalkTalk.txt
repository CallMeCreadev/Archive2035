TalkTalk, a UK-based telecommunications company, suffered a major data breach in October 2015. 
The attack exposed the personal data of millions of customers, causing significant financial and reputational damage to the company

The specific SQL injection vulnerability was found in an outdated web application that TalkTalk had not properly secured. 
The application was part of the company's infrastructure and had not been updated or patched, leaving it open to exploitation.

The attackers were able to access a wide range of customer data, including:
Names, Addresses, Dates of birth, Email addresses, Telephone numbers
Partial credit card and bank details (in some cases, the final six digits of the account numbers were exposed)
