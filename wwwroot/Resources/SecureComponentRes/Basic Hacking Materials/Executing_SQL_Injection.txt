In this folder you will find descriptions about the introductory hacking technique known as the SQL injection.
Most people know how to defend against this basic technique by parameterizing their queries; however, some old sites may still be vulnerbable.
Here is the gist of how it works.

Say you wrote something like this 
string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";

Now what you might think is going to happen is that someone will be entering a username and your query will execute just fine;

Unfortunately it has a critical flaw, what happens if someone decides to pass in ' OR '1'='1?
You pass that value into the query and suddenly what gets sent to the Database is SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1'.
If you didn't know '1' = '1' might as well mean "Just Do It."
