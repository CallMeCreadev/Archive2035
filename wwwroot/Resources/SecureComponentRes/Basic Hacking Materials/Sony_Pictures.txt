In 2011, Sony Pictures was targeted by a group of hackers known as "LulzSec," who used SQL injection to gain 
unauthorized access to the company's databases. The attackers obtained and released personal information, 
including usernames, passwords, and email addresses of millions of users.

One of the most criticized aspects of the hack was that Sony Pictures stored user data, including passwords, 
in plaintext or with weak encryption. This meant that once the data was accessed, it was easily readable and exploitable by the attackers

The breach exposed the personal details of over 1 million users. Sony faced severe criticism for inadequate security measures, 
and the incident was part of a series of high-profile attacks on Sony's network that year.

While The specific details about which part of Sony's website contained the SQL injection vulnerability exploited by LulzSec 
were not publicly disclosed by Sony or security researchers. it's likely that the exploited vulnerability was in a web application 
or form where user input was not properly sanitized.
