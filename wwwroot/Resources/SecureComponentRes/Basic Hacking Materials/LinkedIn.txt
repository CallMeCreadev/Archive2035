In 2012, LinkedIn experienced a major data breach where 6.5 million encrypted passwords were stolen and posted on a Russian hacker forum. 
many have attributed the breach to SQL injection vulnerabilities in LinkedIn's website, allowing attackers to access the user database.
in 2016, it was revealed that the breach was much larger than initially believed, with approximately 167 million LinkedIn accounts compromised.
Specifically, LinkedIn stored passwords using unsalted SHA-1 hashing, a weak encryption method that made it easier for attackers to crack the passwords. 
Salting adds random data to the hashing process, making it much harder for attackers to reverse-engineer passwords.
LinkedIn has not explicitly confirmed or denied whether the 2012 data breach was caused by a SQL injection attack. 
The company did not provide detailed public information about the specific method used by attackers to gain access to their systems.
Instead emphasis was placed on the security weaknesses that allowed the stolen data to be easily cracked once it was obtained.
