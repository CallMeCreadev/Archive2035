In 2008, Heartland Payment Systems, a major U.S. payment processor, suffered a massive security breach due to a SQL injection attack. 
Hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the company's systems, gaining unauthorized access.
The vulnerability was reportedly found in a web application that interacted with the company's internal databases.
The application likely used dynamically constructed SQL queries that incorporated user input directly, without proper sanitization.
The compromised application was querying tables that contained sensitive information, including credit and debit card numbers.
The Heartland Payment Systems breach was part of a larger series of cyberattacks orchestrated by a group led by Albert Gonzalez, a notorious cybercriminal
Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for his role in the Heartland breach and other related cybercrimes.
