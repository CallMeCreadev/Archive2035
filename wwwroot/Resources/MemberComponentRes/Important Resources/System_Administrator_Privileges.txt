The Role of System Administrators

In our organization, system administrators are the custodians of security and functionality. 


Access Codes

System administrators are granted automatic access to our first layer of security which guards the secure file system. 
Future Levels in our system require proper access codes.
Due to poor security some of our systems may be hackable, some codes may even be left lying around in plain text files.
