To pass the security measures and unlock the restricted files, users are required to input a precise sequence of the W, A, S, and D keys. The correct sequence is obscured within a hidden path that guides the user through the correct order. This path is concealed and accessible only by precise mouse clicks on hidden elements.



Activation of the Hidden Path
    	    users can interact with key elements using left click on the mouse, for each successful click a portion of the path will reveal itself.
            This path will visually indicate the required sequence of W, A, S, and D keystrokes.

Executing the Sequence
		Once the path is fully revealed key elements will stop appearing.
		The user should then be able to input the correct W, A, S, D sequence to gain access to the next layer of the system.

Time Limit
    	    The system operates under a strict time constraint. 
            Users must enter the W, A, S, D keystrokes in the correct order and within the designated timeframe to avoid automatic lockout.
		Any incorrect keystroke will reset the path and the user must start the input sequence from beginning.
