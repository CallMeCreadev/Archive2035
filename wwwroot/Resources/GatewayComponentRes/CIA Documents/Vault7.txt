Vault 7 is the name given to a series of documents released by WikiLeaks in March 2017. 
Allegedly leaked from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, these documents detailed the agency's cyber-espionage capabilities and hacking tools. 
The files covered a wide range of techniques used by the CIA to hack into various devices, including smartphones, computers, smart TVs, and even vehicle control systems.

The documents revealed that the CIA had developed or acquired a vast array of tools to exploit vulnerabilities in popular software and hardware. 
This included methods for bypassing antivirus programs, breaking encryption, and gaining remote access to devices. 
Notably, Vault 7 showed that the CIA targeted not just traditional computers but also mobile devices, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and smart home systems.

A key aspect of the Vault 7 documents was the use of "zero-day" exploitsâ€”previously unknown vulnerabilities in software.
These can be exploited before the software vendor has a chance to patch them. 
These exploits were kept secret by the CIA, rather than being disclosed to the companies that could fix them.
