Operation SHAMROCK was a secret U.S. government operation that began during World War II and continued until 1975. 
It was conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA) in collaboration with major American telecommunications companies like Western Union, RCA Global, and ITT. 
The operation involved the systematic interception and monitoring of international telegraph and telephone communications, with the NSA gaining access to virtually 
all international communications passing through these companies. This was done without the knowledge or consent of the public or most government officials.

SHAMROCK can be seen as a precursor to modern mass surveillance practices, 
where large-scale data collection and monitoring of communications are conducted by governments using advanced digital information systems. 
The operation's lack of transparency and oversight raised significant ethical concerns.

The program was exposed in the mid-1970s, leading to congressional investigations, most notably by the Church Committee, 
which criticized the lack of oversight and the potential for abuse. Operation SHAMROCK was officially terminated in 1975.
