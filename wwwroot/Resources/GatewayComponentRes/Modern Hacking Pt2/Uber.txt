In 2017, it was revealed that Uber had experienced a significant data breach in 2016 that exposed the personal information of 57 million users and drivers. 
This breach was partially due to broken access control vulnerabilities within Uber's systems. 
Uber engineers stored sensitive access credentials, including API keys, on a private GitHub repository. 
These credentials were used to access Uber's cloud services, including a data store containing sensitive user information.
Attackers gained access to Uber's GitHub repository, where they discovered the API keys. 
Using these keys, they were able to bypass access controls and gain direct access to Uber's cloud-based data storage.
The attackers accessed a database that contained personal information for millions of users and drivers, 
including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and driverâ€™s license plate numbers.
Instead of disclosing the breach immediately, Uber paid the attackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data and keep the breach confidential.
