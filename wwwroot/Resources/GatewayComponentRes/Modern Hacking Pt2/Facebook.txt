In September 2018, Facebook revealed a major security breach that affected approximately 50 million user accounts. 
The breach was caused by a broken access control vulnerability that allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without their passwords
The vulnerability was linked to Facebook's "View As" feature, which allows users to see what their profile looks like to someone else. 
This feature inadvertently generated an access token that was incorrectly issued with the permissions of the person being "viewed."
When using the "View As" feature, Facebook would generate an access token for the profile being viewed. 
An access token in Facebook's system acts as a key that allows users to remain logged in without entering their password repeatedly. 
Once the attacker obtained the access token for another user, they could log in as that user, bypassing any need for passwords or two-factor authentication.
The attackers could access any account they targeted using the "View As" feature. They could view personal data, post on the user's behalf, 
and access connected applications and services.
