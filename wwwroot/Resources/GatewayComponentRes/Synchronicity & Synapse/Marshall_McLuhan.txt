Marshall McLuhan was a Canadian philosopher and media theorist best known for coining the phrase "the medium is the message" 
and his work on the effects of mass media on human cognition. McLuhan argued that technological advances, 
particularly in media and communication, drive social change and structure human relations. This view, known as technological determinism, 
posits that the tools and technologies a society uses play a key role in shaping its culture and consciousness.
McLuhan introduced the idea of the "Global Village" in 1964, predicting that electronic media would shrink the world, connecting people 
across great distances as if they were living in a small village. McLuhan often used biological metaphors to describe the impact of media on society, 
comparing the global communications network to a human nervous system. In McLuhan's view, media act as synapses, 
facilitating connections and communication between individuals, just as synapses facilitate connections between neurons;
emphasizing the role of media in creating interconnected, networked societies where information flows freely and shapes collective consciousness.
