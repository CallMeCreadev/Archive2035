 B.F. Skinner is best known for developing the theory of operant conditioning, a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior. 
 Skinner identified that behaviors could be shaped and maintained by their consequences, whether through positive reinforcement (rewards), 
 negative reinforcement (removal of an unpleasant stimulus), or punishment. Many modern systems—such as social media platforms, gaming environments, 
 and educational technologies—are designed to reinforce certain user behaviors, leveraging rewards and feedback mechanisms to keep users engaged. 
 Skinner’s work often focused on how behavior could be aligned across individuals through systematic reinforcement. 
 In controlled environments, Skinner showed that consistent reinforcement schedules could produce highly predictable and synchronized behaviors in subjects.
 Skinner’s deterministic view of behavior—where human actions are seen as responses to environmental stimuli rather than free choices—has sparked ongoing 
 debates about free will, autonomy, and the ethics of behavior control.
