Vannevar Bush was an American engineer, inventor, and science administrator, best known for his work during World War II 
and his role in developing the U.S. military-industrial complex. He also served as the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific 
Research and Development (OSRD), where he oversaw projects like the development of the atomic bomb.

In 1945, Bush wrote an influential essay titled "As We May Think," in which he proposed the concept of the Memexâ€”
a theoretical machine that would allow individuals to store and retrieve information efficiently. 
The Memex is often considered a precursor to the modern concept of hypertext and personal computing. 
It envisioned a system where data could be linked together through associative trails, 
laying the groundwork for the development of the internet and digital information systems.
