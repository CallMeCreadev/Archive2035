Joseph Weizenbaum is best known for creating ELIZA in the mid-1960s, one of the first computer programs capable of processing natural language. 
ELIZA simulated a conversation between a human and a machine by following simple, predefined scripts. The most famous script, called "Doctor," 
mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist by responding to user input with open-ended questions, creating the illusion of understanding.
The term "Weizenbaum Effect" refers to the tendency of people to attribute human-like understanding and emotions to computers, 
even when they are merely following algorithms. This phenomenon was observed with ELIZA, where users became emotionally attached to the program, 
despite knowing it was not genuinely intelligent. Weizenbaum was critical of the idea that technology should drive synchronicity in society, 
particularly when it comes at the cost of human values. He believed that while information systems could facilitate communication and coordination, 
they should not dictate human thought or behavior, nor should they replace the nuanced understanding that comes from human interactions.
Weizenbaum became increasingly critical of the field of AI, particularly the idea that computers could or should replace human judgment. 
In his influential book "Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation" (1976), he argued that there are limits 
to what computers should be allowed to do, especially in areas requiring moral and ethical judgment.
