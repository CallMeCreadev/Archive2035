PRISM, as revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013, is a surveillance program that allows the NSA to collect data from major tech companies, 
including Microsoft, Google, Apple, and others. According to the Snowden documents, Microsoft was one of the first companies to join the PRISM program in 2007. 
The NSA allegedly had direct access to Microsoft’s servers, enabling the agency to collect emails, video and voice calls, photos, stored data, file transfers, 
and more from users of Microsoft services like Outlook, Hotmail, and Skype.
The documents suggested that Microsoft worked closely with the NSA to ensure that the agency could circumvent the company’s own encryption protocols. 
For example, it was alleged that Microsoft helped the NSA bypass its encryption to access Outlook and Hotmail emails, including chats in real-time.
Skype, the popular voice-over-IP service acquired by Microsoft in 2011, has also been implicated in allegations of government surveillance. 
It was reported that after Microsoft’s acquisition, Skype’s architecture was modified to allow for interception of communications by the NSA and other intelligence agencies.
There have been long-standing rumors and allegations that Microsoft has included backdoors in its Windows operating system, 
specifically at the request or under the influence of the NSA. 
These backdoors would allow the government to access and control computers running Windows without the user’s knowledge.
In the 1990s, during the development of Windows NT, a cryptographic key labeled “_NSAKEY” was found in the system, 
This lead to widespread speculation that the NSA had a backdoor into Windows. 
Microsoft has publicly denied that it provided the U.S. government with unfettered access to its servers. 
The company stated that it only complied with legal requests and did not voluntarily participate in broad surveillance activities.
