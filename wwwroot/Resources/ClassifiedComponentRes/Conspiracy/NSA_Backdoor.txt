A backdoor is a hidden method for bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, software, or network. 
It allows unauthorized access to the system, enabling surveillance, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. 
Backdoors can be intentionally built into systems by developers, either under coercion, as part of a legal requirement, or for later use by the entity that created them.
One of the most infamous involves the Dual_EC_DRBG, a random number generator standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2006. 
Random number generators are crucial for cryptography because they generate the keys used to encrypt data.
In 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden suggested that the NSA had inserted a backdoor into the Dual_EC_DRBG. 
The allegation was that the NSA had influenced the standardization of Dual_EC_DRBG, knowing that the generator had a predictable pattern that only the NSA could exploit.
This backdoor would allow the NSA to decrypt data encrypted using the flawed generator. 
The backlash led to NIST advising against the use of Dual_EC_DRBG, and many organizations removed it from their cryptographic libraries.
The NSA has been heavily involved in developing and influencing encryption standards. 
While the agency's involvement is partly due to its role in securing U.S. government communications, 
there have been persistent allegations that the NSA has attempted to weaken encryption standards to facilitate its surveillance activities.
