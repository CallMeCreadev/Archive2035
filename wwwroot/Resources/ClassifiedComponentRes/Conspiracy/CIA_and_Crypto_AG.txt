Crypto AG was a Swiss company that specialized in cryptographic communications equipment. 
Founded in the 1940s, the company gained a reputation for providing secure communication devices to governments and organizations worldwide. 
Being based in neutral Switzerland, Crypto AG was considered a trustworthy supplier, and its products were used by over 120 countries during the Cold War and beyond.
In the 1970s, it was revealed that Crypto AG was secretly owned and operated by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
and the West German intelligence agency, Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). The operation was codenamed "Operation Rubicon" (initially known as "Operation Thesaurus"). 
Through this ownership, the CIA and BND had control over the cryptographic algorithms used in Crypto AG's devices.
Crypto AG provided equipment that was intentionally compromised. While customers believed they were purchasing secure communication tools, 
the cryptographic keys and algorithms were subtly weakened, allowing the CIA and BND to decrypt intercepted messages easily. 
Essentially, countries that bought Crypto AG products were unknowingly sharing their most sensitive communications directly with U.S. and West German intelligence.
The operation was remarkably successful and went on for decades. It allowed the CIA and BND to monitor communications from various allies and adversaries. 
Information gleaned through Operation Rubicon provided valuable intelligence during critical periods including the Iran hostage crisis.
In 2020, details of Operation Rubicon were made public through an investigative report by The Washington Post, the German broadcaster ZDF, and the Swiss broadcaster SRF. 
The report confirmed long-held suspicions and exposed the full extent of the operation.
