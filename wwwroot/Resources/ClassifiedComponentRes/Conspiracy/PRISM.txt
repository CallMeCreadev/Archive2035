PRISM is one of the most significant surveillance programs ever disclosed. PRISM is a clandestine surveillance program run by the National Security Agency (NSA) 
that was first publicly revealed in June 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. 
The program is designed to collect and analyze data from digital communications, including emails, chat logs, social media activities, 
stored files, voice and video calls, and other forms of online communication. 
PRISM operates under the legal framework of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), specifically the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 
which allows the U.S. government to target non-U.S. citizens located outside of the United States for intelligence purposes.
According to the Snowden leaks, companies like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and others were involved in the PRISM program. 
These companies were legally required to comply with the NSA's data requests and provide access to their servers. 
In some cases, the cooperation was voluntary, while in others, it was enforced through legal orders.
While PRISM is intended to target non-U.S. citizens, the program inevitably sweeps up communications involving U.S. citizens and residents as well.
The secretive nature of PRISM, and the fact that it operated under classified legal orders, 
meant that the public was largely unaware of the program’s existence until Snowden’s disclosures.
In response to the PRISM revelations, many tech companies began implementing stronger encryption practices. 
For example, Google and Yahoo started encrypting data as it moved between their data centers to prevent unauthorized access. 
End-to-end encryption, where even the company cannot access the user’s data, became more common in messaging services like WhatsApp and iMessage.
In 2018, Microsoft introduced end-to-end encryption for Skype with the rollout of "Private Conversations." 
This feature allowed users to have encrypted voice calls, text messages, and file transfers. 
However, this was not the default setting and needed to be enabled for each conversation.
