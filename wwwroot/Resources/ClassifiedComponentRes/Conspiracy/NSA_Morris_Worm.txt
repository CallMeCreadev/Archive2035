The Morris Worm, released on November 2, 1988, is often considered the first major computer worm to spread across the Internet. 
It was created by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University, as an experiment to gauge the size of the Internet. 
However, due to a programming error, the worm replicated more aggressively than intended, causing widespread disruption.
While Morris publicly stated that the worm was an unintended experiment gone wrong, conspiracy theories began to circulate, 
suggesting that the worm might have had ties to the NSA or other government agencies. These theories were fueled by several factors:
Robert Tappan Morris's father, Robert Morris Sr., was a prominent cryptographer who worked at Bell Labs 
and later became the chief scientist at the NSA's National Computer Security Center. 
His position and expertise in cybersecurity fueled speculation that his son might have been involved in a covert NSA operation or experiment.
The worm was released during a period of heightened awareness and concern about cybersecurity. 
The NSA and other government agencies were increasingly interested in the security of the Internet and networks, 
leading some to speculate that the worm might have been a deliberate test or demonstration of vulnerabilities.
While it's possible that the NSA monitored the incident or studied the worm's effects, there is no substantiated link between the NSA and the creation of the worm.
