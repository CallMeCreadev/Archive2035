The Myspace XSS vulnerability, often referred to as the "Samy Worm," is an infamous examples of XSS exploitation in the early days of social media. 
The worm was created by a security researcher named Samy Kamkar, who used XSS to propagate a self-replicating worm across the Myspace platform.
In 2005, Myspace allowed users to customize their profiles with HTML and CSS. 
However, the platform did not properly sanitize user input, leaving it vulnerable to XSS attacks. 
Samy Kamkar discovered this vulnerability and crafted a payload that would execute JavaScript code when someone viewed an infected profile.
he malicious code was designed to automatically add Samy Kamkar as a friend and display a message stating "but most of all, Samy is my hero" on the victimâ€™s profile. 
More importantly, the worm would replicate itself onto any profile that viewed an infected profile, causing it to spread rapidly across the platform.
Within 20 hours, the Samy Worm had infected over 1 million Myspace profiles.
Samy Kamkar was eventually caught and faced legal consequences. 
He was sentenced to probation and banned from using the internet without permission from the authorities for several years.
