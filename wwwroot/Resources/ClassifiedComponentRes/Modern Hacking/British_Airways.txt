In 2018, British Airways suffered a significant data breach that exposed the personal and financial information of approximately 380,000 customers. 
While the breach was primarily due to a compromise of British Airways' website and mobile app, XSS vulnerabilities played a critical role in the attack.
The breach was executed by a group known as Magecart, which specializes in injecting malicious scripts into websites to skim credit card information. 
The attackers exploited XSS vulnerabilities to inject malicious JavaScript into British Airways' website. 
This script captured payment details entered by users during transactions and sent the data to a server controlled by the attackers.
The attackers compromised a third-party script (likely an analytics or marketing script) that British Airways had included on its website. 
This compromised script was then loaded by the website every time a user visited a specific page, such as the payment page.
Unlike typical breaches where data is stolen from a backend database, this attack skimmed data in real-time as customers were entering it. 
This made the breach particularly effective and difficult to detect quickly.
This incident highlighted the risks associated with third-party scripts and the importance of securing the entire web application, including any external resources.
