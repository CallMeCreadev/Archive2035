Occuring in 2010, Stuxnet is one of the most famous examples of a cyber weapon used in a military context, 
widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel to target Iran's nuclear program.

Stuxnet was a highly sophisticated worm that exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows to spread and deliver its payload. 
The worm's propagation began with a "patient-zero" machine, which was initially infected via a USB drive.

The first vulnerability Stuxnet exploited was in the handling of .lnk files (Windows shortcut files). 
When the icon for a specially crafted .lnk file was displayed in Windows Explorer, it triggered the execution of the malicious code embedded within the file 
without any user interaction. This allowed Stuxnet to spread through USB drives and other removable mediaâ€”
simply viewing the contents of an infected USB drive in Windows Explorer was enough to execute the Stuxnet payload.

Once a machine was infected via USB, Stuxnet exploited a second vulnerability that allowed remote code execution through the Windows Print Spooler service. 
This enabled the worm to propagate across a network by sending malicious print requests to printers connected to other systems, 
allowing Stuxnet to spread through shared printers and infect machines on the same network.

The worm then targeted machines with network shares available, exploiting a buffer overflow in the Server service to propagate through Windows networks 
without needing user interaction.

After successfully spreading, Stuxnet specifically targeted Siemens S7 PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). 
It reprogrammed these PLCs to damage uranium enrichment centrifuges while falsely reporting normal operations to monitoring systems, 
effectively sabotaging Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts.
