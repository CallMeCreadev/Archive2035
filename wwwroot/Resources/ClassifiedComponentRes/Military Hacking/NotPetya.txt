NotPetya was a devastating cyberattack that initially targeted Ukraine but quickly spread globally, causing billions of dollars in damage. 
It is widely attributed to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. 
The attack was disguised as ransomware, but its true purpose was to cause widespread disruption, 
particularly targeting Ukraineâ€™s infrastructure during a period of heightened tension between Ukraine and Russia.
NotPetya spread through a compromised update mechanism for a popular Ukrainian accounting software, M.E.Doc. 
Once inside a network, it exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability and moved across systems, encrypting the master boot record (MBR), rendering devices inoperable.
EternalBlue exploited a vulnerability in the SMBv1 (Server Message Block version 1) protocol, allowing remote code execution. 
It leveraged a buffer overflow in the srv.sys driver, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable machines.
The EternalBlue exploit was developed by the NSA and was later leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacking group, making it available to cybercriminals and nation-state actors.
