Buckshot Yankee was the codename for a significant cyber intrusion into U.S. military networks occuring in 2008. 
The breach is believed to have been conducted by Russian operatives.
The operation’s objective was to infiltrate classified U.S. military networks and gather intelligence.
The attack began when an infected USB flash drive was inserted into a laptop connected to the U.S. Central Command’s network.
When the drive was inserted into a computer, the malware automatically executed, leveraging the Windows Autorun feature. 
Once executed, the malware, known as Agent.btz, created a backdoor on the infected systems.
The malware spread through classified and unclassified networks, exfiltrating sensitive data back to the attackers.
In response to Buckshot Yankee, the Department of Defense banned the use of USB drives on military networks and initiated widespread network security improvements.
