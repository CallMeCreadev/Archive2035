Operation Aurora was a series of cyberattacks primarily targeting Google, Adobe, and other major companies. 
The operation is believed to have been conducted by a state-sponsored group linked to the Chinese government
The attackers sought to steal intellectual property, gain access to corporate secrets, and compromise the accounts of human rights activists who were using Gmail.
The attack involved exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer, allowing attackers to install malware on the computers of targeted users.
This vulnerability was a heap buffer overflow in the mshtml.dll library, which is responsible for rendering web pages in Internet Explorer.
A heap buffer overflow occurs when data is written to a memory buffer (a specific area of memory) and overflows into adjacent memory locations. 
In the case of CVE-2010-0249, the vulnerability allowed attackers to craft a malicious webpage
This would cause Internet Explorer to overwrite memory in a way that could be controlled by the attacker.
By exploiting this overflow, the attackers could manipulate the browser's execution flow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. 
Once inside the network, the attackers could move laterally, exfiltrating sensitive data from the victims machines.
