You Have Unlocked a new gameplay mode:
    Elite mode builds on the gameplay from level 5:
        Time is set to 60 seconds and every wasd puzzle solve adds 24 seconds to the clock:        
        after 5 solves the length of puzzles increases by 2
        after 10 solves the length of puzzles increases by 4 and target spawn frequency is increased by 15%
        after 15 solves the length of puzzles increases by 6
        after 20 solves the length of puzzles increases by 8 and target spawn frequency is increased by 30%

        This mode will continue scaling with target spawn rate increasing by 15% every 10 solves and puzzle length increasing by 2 every 5 solves
